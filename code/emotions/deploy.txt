Replace the mock GPIO class with:

    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

Connect your hardware:

    Servo motors to the appropriate GPIO pins
    Speakers for audio output
    Display if you're using one


I'll modify the code to include RGB LED control, which can show different colors based on emotions. Let me update the robot controller with this functionality.

I've added RGB LED functionality to your P-E-BO Desk Companion code. Here are the key additions:
1. RGB LED Hardware Control

Added pins for red, green, and blue LED components (GPIO pins 22, 23, and 24)
Implemented PWM control for smooth color transitions and brightness control
Created a method to set precise RGB colors (0-255 for each component)

4. Testing Tools

Added a separate test function (test_led_colors()) that you can run to check just the LED functionality
Tests basic colors (red, green, blue, yellow, etc.) and fade effects

Raspberry Pi Hardware Setup Instructions:

Connect your RGB LED:

Connect the red pin to GPIO 22
Connect the green pin to GPIO 23
Connect the blue pin to GPIO 24
Connect the common ground (for common cathode LED) or common power (for common anode LED)
Add appropriate resistors (typically 220-330 ohm) to each color leg


For a common cathode RGB LED:

LED common pin connects to ground
Each color pin connects through a resistor to the GPIO pin


For a common anode RGB LED:

LED common pin connects to 3.3V
You'll need to invert the PWM logic (subtract duty cycle from 100)



To run this code on your Raspberry Pi, you'll need to:

Replace the mock GPIO class with the real one by uncommenting import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
Make sure pyttsx3 and pygame are installed
Run the program: python robot_controller.py
